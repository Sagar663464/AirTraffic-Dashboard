# Air Traffic Dashboard

Aviation Industry is growing very rapidly on a yearly basis. So to find out the actual growth, we need to visualize the data and make it easy to understand for everyone. For this visualization, I've used Power BI. By looking at the dashboard, we'll be able to understand the growth of aviation industry based on few factors. Power BI is used because it is much more convenient than any other business intelligence tools out there.

The data here I used is from 2005 to 2015. So by analyzing the data, we can understand the growth the aviation industry is going through in past decade. We can also understand that the most passengers travelled domestically. So by presenting with visually appealing charts, we'll be able to understand the data in much more easier way.
