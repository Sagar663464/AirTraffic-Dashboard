# Air Traffic Dashboard

Aviation Industry is growing in a good rate yearly. So to monitor the overall stats, I built a dashboard using Power BI. I used tools like Power Query to tranform the data a little bit. By using this dashboard we'll be able to analyze the performance of Airline industry in the field of passenger flights. 

## Data

The columns dataset consists of : 
 - Activity Period
 - Operating Airline
 - Operating Airline IATA Code
 - Published Airline
 - Published Airline IATA Code
 - GEO Summary
 - GEO Region
 - Activity Type Code
 - Price Category Code
 - Terminal
 - Boarding Area
 - Passenger Count
 - Adjusted Activity Type Code
 - Adjusted Passenger Count
 - Year
 - Month
